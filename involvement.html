    At Georgia Tech I play saxophone in the marching band and pep band, am a sister of Tau Beta Sigma (a co-ed band service sorority), and am the Social Chair for Band Club. I love making music, especially with others. Through these activities I have not only gained friends who have a similar appreciation for music, but also a group of people who I can rely on for anything and who I see as a second family.</p>
